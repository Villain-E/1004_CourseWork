This project is a simple platformer game that allows the player to move and jump around while avoiding danger.
Once the player reaches the end of the stage, the characterâ€™s position will reset and new obsticles will be added to the stage, but the rest of the stage will remain the same.
This means that each level will be familiar to the player but will have a new danger that the player will need to work around.
Move with the arrow keys, jump with up, reset the stage with 'r', shoot bullets by pressing the spacebar while moving in either direction.
This game includes 16 different stages of increasing difficulty.
